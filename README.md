# Advent of Code 2022

Welcome to my solutions for the 2022 Advent of Code. This is a yearly event where each day
requires writing some code to solve a particular problem and then submitting the answer.
Full details can be found at: https://adventofcode.com/2022

I've developed these solutions in kotlin.

For each day I'm planning on creating two solutions. The first will be built using
test-driven development (TDD) and have a property constructed domain model and associated
types. The second will be derived from my understanding of the problem and aim to implement
a solution in the most concise way possible with a minimal number of lines.

In addition, I've adopted the position that where part 2 of each day's problem would
result in part 1 no longer running then my primary solution will implement both part 1
and part 2. This is instead of refactoring part 1 into the part 2 solution. Where I need to
do this I will aim that the part 2 implementation builds on top of code written for part 1
rather than replacing it with something different.

Each day has a separate README file in the source directory.
