# Day 7

## Full Version

I didn't get a lot of time to work on this today and for some reason I had a bit of a mental
block on writing the parsing code. Once I got that into some sort of usable structure the rest
was some pretty simple collection manipulation.

### Minimal Version

Came back to this on day 8. Created a much simpler parsing solution that actually builds the directory
hierarchy rather than a flat structure of all the directories. Also realised that there's no need to
actually hold details of any files, just the total file size in each directory.
