# Day 7

## Full Version

I didn't get a lot of time to work on this today and for some reason I had a bit of a mental
block on writing the parsing code. Once I got that into some sort of usable structure the rest
was some pretty simple collection manipulation.

Didn't get time to try to optimise this further.
