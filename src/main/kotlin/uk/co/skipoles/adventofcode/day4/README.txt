# Day 4

This day has two parts that are only different by the filtering conditioning on the data.

## Full Version

My full implementation is actually pretty minimal in terms of code. It just turns things into a pair
of Range objects and then filters on overlap criteria.

Given how simple the code today turned out, there doesn't seem to be much value in trying to produce
a more minimal version!
